abstract = {Background AD is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease, severely impacting our society. Early diagnosis and prognosis are challenging tasks in the management of AD patients. New Method We implemented a machine-learning classifier for the automatic early diagnosis and prognosis of AD by means of features extracted, selected and optimized from structural MRI brain images. The classifier was designed to perform multi-label automatic classification into the following four classes: HC, ncMCI, cMCI, and AD. Results From our analyses, it emerged that MMSE and hippocampus-related measures must be included as primary measures in automatic-classification systems for both the early diagnosis and the prognosis of AD. The voting scheme mainly based on the binary-classification performances on the different four groups is the best choice to model the multi-label decision function for AD, when compared with a simple majority-vote scheme or with a scheme aimed at discriminating patients with high vs low risk of conversion to AD and therapy addressing. Comparison with Existing Method(s) The accuracies of our binary classifications were higher than or comparable to previously published methods. An improvement is needed on the approach we used to combine binary-classification outputs to obtain the final multi-label classification. Conclusions The performance of multi-label automatic-classification systems strongly depends on the choice of the voting scheme used for combining binary-classification labels.},

abstract = {The current gold standard for diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) includes subjective measures, such as clinical interview, observation, and rating scales. The significant heterogeneity of ADHD symptoms represents a challenge for this assessment, and could prevent an accurate diagnosis. The aim of the present work was to investigate the ability of a multi-domain profile of measures, including blood fatty acid profiles, neuropsychological measures, and functional measures from near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), to correctly recognize school-aged children with ADHD. To answer this question, we elaborated a supervised machine learning method to accurately discriminate 22 children with ADHD from 22 children with typical development by means of the proposed profile of measures. To assess the performance of our classifier, we adopted a nested 10-fold cross validation, where the original dataset was split into 10 subsets of equal size, which were used repeatedly for training and testing. Each subset was used once for performance validation. Our method reached a maximum diagnostic accuracy of 81% through the combining of the predictive models trained on neuropsychological, fatty acid profiles, and deoxygenated hemoglobin features. With respect to the analysis of a single-domain dataset per time, the most discriminant neuropsychological features were measures of vigilance, focused and sustained attention, and cognitive flexibility; the most discriminating blood fatty acids were linoleic acid and the total amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Lastly, with respect to the fNIRS data, we found a significant advantage of the deoxygenated hemoglobin over the oxygenated hemoglobin data in terms of predictive accuracy. These preliminary findings show the feasibility and applicability of our machine learning method in correctly identifying children with ADHD based on multi-domain data. The present machine learning classification approach might be helpful for supporting the clinical practice of diagnosing ADHD, even fostering a computer-aided diagnosis perspective.},

A neuropsychological assessment plays a crucial role in detecting such changes from normal conditions. However, despite the existence of clinical measures that are used to classify and diagnose AD, a large amount of subjectivity continues to exist. Our aim was to assess the potential of machine learning in quantifying this process and optimizing or even reducing the amount of neuropsychological tests used to classify AD patients, also at an early stage of impairment. We investigated the role of twelve state-of-the-art neuropsychological tests in the automatic classification of subjects with none, mild, or severe impairment as measured by the clinical dementia rating (CDR). Data were obtained from the ADNI database. In the groups of measures used as features, we included measures of both cognitive domains and subdomains. Our findings show that some tests are more frequently best predictors for the automatic classification, namely, LM, ADAS-Cog, AVLT, and FAQ, with amajor role of the ADAS-Cogmeasures of delayed and immediate memory and the FAQmeasure of financial competency.},

abstract = {One of the current challenges in Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related research is to achieve an early and definite diagnosis. Automatic classification of AD is typically based on the use of feature vectors of high dimensionality, containing few training patterns, which leads to the curse-of-dimensionality problem. It is indispensable to find good approaches for selecting a subset of the original set of features. In this work, a method to perform early diagnosis of AD is proposed, combining different feature reduction approaches on both brain MRI studies and expression values of blood plasma proteins. Each selected set of features is used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM), then the set of SVM is combined by weighted sum rule. Moreover, a novel approach for considering the feature vector as an image is proposed, different texture descriptors are extracted from the image and used to train a SVM. The superior performance of the proposed system is obtained without any ad hoc parameter optimization (i.e., the same ensemble of classifiers and the same parameter settings are used in all datasets). The MATLAB code for the ensemble of classifiers will be publicly available.},

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) could be used as in vivo, non invasive tool to identify sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression. In recent years, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and machine- learning algorithms have attracted strong interest within the neuroimaging community, as they allow automatic classification of imaging data with higher performance than univariate statistical analysis. An exhaustive search of PubMed, Web of Science and Medline records was performed in this work, in order to retrieve studies focused on the potential role of MRI in aiding the clinician in early diagnosis of AD by using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as MVPA automated classification method. A total of 30 studies emerged, published from 2008 to date. This review aims to give a state-of-the-art overview about SVM for the early and differential diagnosis of AD-related pathologies by means of MRI data, starting from preliminary steps such as image pre-processing, feature extraction and feature selection, and ending with classification, validation strategies and extraction of MRI-related biomarkers. The main advantages and drawbacks of the different techniques were explored. Results obtained by the reviewed studies were reported in terms of classification performance and biomarker outcomes, in order to shed light on the parameters that accompany normal and pathological aging. Unresolved issues and possible future directions were finally pointed out.},

The aim of this work was to assess the feasibility of a machine learning method for extracting reliable neuroimaging features allowing individual categorization of patients with ED. Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique, combined with a pattern recognition method, was employed utilizing structural magnetic resonance images. Seventeen females with ED (six with diagnosis of anorexia nervosa and 11 with bulimia nervosa) were compared against 17 body mass index-matched healthy controls (HC). Machine learning allowed individual diagnosis of ED versus HC with an Accuracy ≥ 0.80. Voxel-based pattern recognition analysis demonstrated that voxels influencing the classification Accuracy involved the occipital cortex, the posterior cerebellar lobule, precuneus, sensorimotor/premotor cortices, and the medial prefrontal cortex, all critical regions known to be strongly involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of ED. Although these findings should be considered preliminary given the small size investigated, SVM analysis highlights the role of well-known brain regions as possible biomarkers to distinguish ED from HC at an individual level, thus encouraging the translational implementation of this new multivariate approach in the clinical practice.},

The question that rises is whether these implementations may introduce some technology-specific effects to be considered in neuropsychological evaluations. Two core aspects have been investigated in this work: the efficacy of tests and the clinical ecology of their administration (the ability to measure real-world test performance), specifically (1) the testing efficacy of a computerized test when response to stimuli is measured using a touch-screen compared to a conventional mouse-control response device; (2) the testing efficacy of a computerized test with respect to different input modalities (visual versus verbal); and (3) the ecology of two computerized assessment modalities (touch-screen and mouse-control), including preference measurements of participants. Our results suggest that (1) touch-screen devices are suitable for administering experimental tasks requiring precise timings for detection, (2) intrinsic nature of neuropsychological tests should always be respected in terms of stimuli presentation when translated to new digitalized environment, and (3) touch-screen devices result in ecological instruments being proposed for the computerized administration of neuropsychological tests with a high level of preference from elderly people.},

Results: The algorithm allowed individual diagnosis of PD versus controls, PSP versus controls and PSP versus PD with an Accuracy, Specificity and Sensitivity. {\textgreater}. 90{\%}. Voxels influencing classification between PD and PSP patients involved midbrain, pons, corpus callosum and thalamus, four critical regions known to be strongly involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of PSP.

An operator-independent technique, based on an optimised threshold of the maximum lesion uptake, allows to define an isocontour around the lesion on PET images in order to measure both lesion radioactivity uptake and lesion metabolic volume. RC are experimentally derived from PET measurements of hot spheres in hot background, miming oncological lesions. RC were obtained as a function of PET measured sphere-to-background ratio and PET measured sphere metabolic volume, both resulting from the threshold-isocontour technique.

abstract = {Decision support systems for the assisted medical diagnosis offer the main feature of giving assessments which are poorly affected from arbitrary clinical reasoning. Aim of this work was to assess the feasibility of a decision support system for the assisted diagnosis of brain cancer, such approach presenting potential for early diagnosis of tumors and for the classification of the degree of the disease progression. For this purpose, a supervised learning algorithm combined with a pattern recognition method was developed and cross-validated in 18F-FDG PET studies of a model of a brain tumour implantation.},
