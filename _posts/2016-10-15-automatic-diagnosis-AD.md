During my three years of doctoral project, which ended in December 2015, I studied -among other topics- the implementation of an intelligent system able to automatically classify patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

As you all know, AD is the most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting millions of people worldwide. Although this condition has been known for more than a hundred years, there is still no definite diagnosis. More difficult than this, diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) -which can be simply described as a pre-clinical and pre-symptomatic condition that may (MCIc) or may not (MCInc) convert to AD- is one of the biggest challenges in medicine.

>Predicting the conversion of MCI to AD is one of the biggest challenges

These considerations alone are able to explain the great race of the last few years for the implementation of machine learning algorithms able to automatically diagnosing AD and/or predicting the conversion of MCI.

### The great race for machine learning in AD
In the last few years, there has been a great race for the implementation of automatic algorithms

### Classification performance: state of the art
These tables are intended to be a summary of the state-of-the-art classification performance of AD using public datasets. Please, feel free to [fill in the form](http://path_to_form) if any data is missing or wrong.
