I have written in this blog about the importance of having shared datasets on which algorithms could be validated (<a href="https://christiansalvatore.github.io/2016-10-21/automatic-diagnosis-AD/" target="_blank">link</a>).
<br>This is fundamental to obtain comparable performances, which is particularly important when we are dealing with medical systems, such as those used to automatically diagnose neurodegenerative diseases.

In these months, "<a href="https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/mci-prediction" target="_blank">A Machine learning neuroimaging challenge for automated diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)</a>" is being held on the Kaggle platform.
<br>This challenge makes use of data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), asking competitors to automatically classify patients belonging to four different classes: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MCI-converter to AD (cMCI), MCI-not converter to AD (ncMCI), and Healthy Controls (HC).

So, a four-label classification problem.

Considering that the accuracy for random guessing is 25%, we are curious to see what will be the accuracy reached by the best team.

So, stay tuned!
